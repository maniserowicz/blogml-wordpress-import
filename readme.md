BlogML WordPress import script
=========

Original script is available [here](http://www.kavinda.net/content/other/BlogML-WordPress-Import.zip). From what I read in [this](http://www.craigbailey.net/migrating-from-blogengine-net-to-wordpress/) blog post, it was created by [Aaron Lerch](http://www.aaronlerch.com/blog/) but readme says otherwise so I'm not sure.

It lacked support for importing tags from BlogML format - it was simply ignoring them. I added some PHP code to support tags import, the same way categories were handled.
